\usage{
pulsar(
  data,
  fun = huge::huge,
  fargs = list(),
  criterion = c("stars"),
  thresh = 0.1,
  subsample.ratio = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \eqn{n*p} matrix of data matrix input to solve for the \eqn{p*p} graphical model}

\item{fun}{pass in a function that returns a list representing \eqn{p*p} sparse, undirected graphical models along the desired regularization path. The expected inputs to this function are: a data matrix input and a sequence of decreasing lambdas and must return a list or S3 object with a member \emph{named} \code{path}. This should be a list of adjacency matrices for each value of \code{lambda}. See \code{\link{pulsar-function}} for more information.}

\item{fargs}{arguments to argument \code{fun}. Must be a named list and requires at least one member \code{lambda}, a numeric vector with values for the penalty parameter.}

\item{criterion}{A character vector of selection statistics. Multiple criteria can be supplied. Only StARS can be used to automatically select an optimal index for the lambda path. See details for additional statistics.}

\item{thresh}{threshold (referred to as scalar \eqn{\beta} in StARS publication) for selection criterion. Only implemented for StARS. \code{thresh=0.1} is recommended.}

\item{subsample.ratio}{determine the size of the subsamples (referred to as \eqn{b(n)/n}). Default is 10*sqrt(n)/n for n > 144 or 0.8 otherwise. Should be strictly less than 1.}

\item{rep.num}{number of random subsamples \eqn{N} to take for graph re-estimation. Default is \eqn{N=20}, but more is recommended for non-StARS criteria or if using edge frequencies as confidence scores.}

\item{seed}{A numeric seed to force predictable subsampling. Default is NULL. Use for testing purposes only.}

\item{lb.stars}{Should the lower bound be computed after the first \eqn{N=2} subsamples (should result in considerable speedup and only implemented if stars is selected). If this option is selected, other summary metrics will only be applied to the smaller lambda path.}

\item{ub.stars}{Should the upper bound be computed after the first \eqn{N=2} subsamples (should result in considerable speedup and only implemented if stars is selected). If this option is selected, other summary metrics will only be applied to the smaller lambda path. This option is ignored if the lb.stars flag is FALSE.}

\item{ncores}{number of cores to use for subsampling. See \code{batch.pulsar} for more parallelization options.}

\item{refit}{Boolean flag to refit on the full dataset after pulsar is run. (see also \code{\link{refit}})}
}
\value{
an S3 object of class \code{pulsar} with a named member for each stability metric run. Within each of these are:
\itemize{
   \item summary: the summary statistic over \code{rep.num} graphs at each value of lambda
   \item criterion: the stability criterion used
   \item merge: the raw statistic over the \code{rep.num} graphs, prior to summarization
   \item opt.ind: index (along the path) of optimal lambda selected by the criterion at the desired threshold. Will return \eqn{0} if no optimum is found or \code{NULL} if selection for the criterion is not implemented.
  }
If \code{stars} is included as a criterion then additional arguments include
\itemize{
   \item lb.index: the lambda index of the lower bound at \eqn{N=2} samples if \code{lb.stars} flag is set to TRUE
   \item ub.index: the lambda index of the upper bound at \eqn{N=2} samples if \code{ub.stars} flag is set to TRUE
}

call: the original function call
}
\description{
Run pulsar using StARS' edge stability (or other criteria) to select an undirected graphical model over a lambda path.

\details{
The options for \code{criterion} statistics are:
\itemize{
   \item stars (Stability approach to regularization selection)
   \item gcd   (Graphet correlation distance, requires the \pkg{orca} package) see \code{\link{gcvec}}
   \item diss  (Node-node dissimilarity) see \code{\link{graph.diss}}
   \item estrada (estrada class) see \code{\link{estrada.class}}
   \item nc  (natural connectivity) see \code{\link{natural.connectivity}}
   \item sufficiency (Tandon & Ravikumar's sufficiency statistic)
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
## Generate the data with huge:
library(huge)
p <- 40 ; n <- 1200
dat   <- huge.generator(n, p, "hub", verbose=FALSE, v=.1, u=.3)
lams  <- getLamPath(getMaxCov(dat$data), .01, len=20)

## Run pulsar with huge
hugeargs <- list(lambda=lams, verbose=FALSE)
out.p <- pulsar(dat$data, fun=huge::huge, fargs=hugeargs,
                rep.num=20, criterion='stars')

## Run pulsar in bounded stars mode and include gcd metric:
out.b <- pulsar(dat$data, fun=huge::huge, fargs=hugeargs,
                rep.num=20, criterion=c('stars', 'gcd'),
                lb.stars=TRUE, ub.stars=TRUE)
plot(out.b)
}
